# Wheather-trends-analysis 
This project analyzes the wheather trends in my city Riyadh and global temperatue averages to compare the similarity and differences of the wheather over the years.  
As can be seen in this chart, the moving averages depict Riyadh has always been
hotter than the global average over the years. Also, they both show a slight increase as the
five-year moving average smoothly rises up mostly, which can be interpreted that
temperature in the future might heat up more. Riyadh’s moving average line might
change in a few averages rabidly unlike the global moving average line that appears to be
going up with less fluctuations. Thus, Riyadh’s possibility of making noticeable
differences in the next five years is higher than global temperature average that might
make an unremarkable change.
